                 My name is Karim, and I go to York University. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's of Arts in Information Technology. On my free time, I like to help my father with his work on computers, since he is a computer technician (which explains why I am pursuing this field of education). My hobbies are listening to music, organizing my files, and playing video games. My favorite things to do however, is go to the gym, spend time with my family and friends, and trying new restaurants. If I had to eat one thing for the rest of my life, it'd be chicken.
                <p>
		I went to Agincourt Collegiate Institute, where I graduated with honors (meaning I had an average above 85%). I am deeply involved in my community and extracurricular activities. Every summer, I work at a summer camp and volunteer at various food banks in my area. I am connected with the figures in my community who are in charge of outreach and through them I learn better skills in working with people.

                  I am very into Hip-Hop and its sub-cultures and genres. I would say I'm very "tapped in". One of my works linked below is an essay I wrote about Lil Uzi Vert as a final piece for one of my Humanities courses. I enjoy studying the field of IT becuase computers have been a part of my life since I was a child. I used to have computer parts as toys because my father would give them to me. My favorite songs right now are either Shanghai by Hardrock or Werkin by OsamaSon.

Linked below are some of my works that I am most proud of. Just some papers and art.
